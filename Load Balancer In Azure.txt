Project Steps to Configure Load Balancer in Azure
Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to achieve your project objectives using the Azure portal:

1. Create a Resource Group
1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
2. Navigate to "Resource groups."
3. Click "Create."
4. Enter the Resource group name (e.g., EcommercePlatformRG).
5. Choose the appropriate region.

2. Create a Virtual Network (VNet) and Subnets
1. Navigate to "Virtual networks."
2. Click "Create."
3. Enter the following details:
Name: EcommerceVNet
Region: Same as the resource group
4. Click on "IP Addresses" and add subnets:
Resource Subnet:
Name: ResourceSubnet
Address range: 10.0.1.0/24
Azure Bastion Subnet:
Name: AzureBastionSubnet
Address range: 10.0.2.0/24
5. Click "Review + create" and then "Create."

3. Create a NAT Gateway
1. Navigate to "NAT gateways."
2. Click "Create."
3. Enter the following details:
Name: EcommerceNATGateway
Resource group: EcommercePlatformRG
Region: Same as the VNet
4. Assign a Public IP:
Click "Public IP addresses" > "+ Add"
Name: NATGatewayPublicIP
SKU: Standard
5. Click "OK"
6. Under "Subnets," associate the NAT Gateway with the ResourceSubnet.
7. Click "Review + create" and then "Create."

4. Set Up Azure Bastion
1. Navigate to "Bastions."
2. Click "Create."
3. Enter the following details:
Name: EcommerceBastion
Resource group: EcommercePlatformRG
Virtual network: EcommerceVNet
Subnet: AzureBastionSubnet
4. Click "IP configuration" and create a new Public IP:
Name: BastionPublicIP
SKU: Standard
Assignment: Static
5. Click "Review + create" and then "Create."

5. Create a Zone-Redundant Load Balancer
1. Navigate to "Load balancers."
2. Click "Create."
3. Enter the following details:
Name: EcommerceLB
Region: Same as the resource group
SKU: Standard
Type: Public
4. Click "Frontend IP configuration" and create a new Public IP:
Name: LBPublicIP
SKU: Standard
Assignment: Static
5. Click "Backend pools" and add a new backend pool:
Name: EcommerceBackendPool
Add the ResourceSubnet
6. Click "Inbound rules" and create a new rule:
Name: HTTPRule
Port: 80
Backend port: 80
Health probe: Create a new health probe (Name: HTTPProbe, Protocol: HTTP, Port: 80)
7. Click "Review + create" and then "Create."

6. Create Virtual Machines (VMs)
1. Navigate to "Virtual machines."
2. Click "Create" > "Azure virtual machine."
3. Enter the following details for the first VM:
Name: lb-vm1
Resource group: EcommercePlatformRG
Region: Same as the resource group
Availability options: Availability zone
Zone: 1
Image: Windows Server 2019 Datacenter
Size: Standard_DS1_v2
Username: azureuser
Password: (your password)
4. Under "Networking," choose:
Virtual network: EcommerceVNet
Subnet: ResourceSubnet
Public IP: None
5. Click "Review + create" and then "Create."
6. Repeat the steps for the second VM (lb-vm2) but choose Zone 2.

7. Install IIS on Both VMs
1. Navigate to each VM and click "Connect" > "Bastion."
2.Enter the username and password to connect.
3. Once connected, open PowerShell and run the following command to install IIS:
Install-WindowsFeature -name Web-Server -IncludeManagementTools

8. Add VMs to Load Balancer Backend Pool
1. Navigate to "Load balancers" > EcommerceLB > "Backend pools."
2. Click on EcommerceBackendPool > "Add" > "Virtual machines."
3. Select lb-vm1 and lb-vm2.
4. Click "Save."

9. Test the Load Balancer
1. Obtain the Public IP address of the load balancer from the "Frontend IP configurations" tab.
2. Open a web browser and navigate to the Public IP.
3. You should see the default IIS web page.

This setup will ensure your e-commerce platform can handle increased traffic with high availability and load distribution across multiple zones.
